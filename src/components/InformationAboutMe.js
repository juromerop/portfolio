      Hi there, my name is Juan Garzon and I am currently studying Systems Engineering. However, my true passion lies in the field of web development. I am constantly seeking to expand my knowledge in this area and improve my skills every day. I have found that React is the perfect tool for me to use in my web development projects and I am thoroughly enjoying the process of learning and building with it. Outside of my academic and professional pursuits, I am an avid lover of life and I always strive to make the most out of every day.
