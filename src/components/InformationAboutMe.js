    <p>
      Hi there, my name is Juan Pablo Garzon Parra and I am currently studying
      Systems Engineering. However, my true passion lies in the field of web
      development. I am constantly seeking to expand my knowledge in this area
      and improve my skills every day. I have found that React is the perfect
      tool for me to use in my web development projects and I am thoroughly
      enjoying the process of learning and building with it. Outside of my
      academic and professional pursuits, I have a deep appreciation for nature
      and love to spend time outdoors. I also enjoy unwinding with some video
      games in my free time. All in all, I am a driven individual with a passion
      for technology, a love of nature, and a desire to make the most out of
      every day.
    </p>
